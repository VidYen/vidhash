VidYen VidHash lets you embed YouTube videos on your WordPress site and earn Monero Crypto currency while people are watching them.

== Description ==

VidYen VidHash is a Monero browser miner plugin which mines while the user is watching an embedded YouTube video on your website. Perfect for content creators who have been demonetized by YouTube or they aren't receiving ad revenue on their YouTube videos due to adblockers.

While the video is playing, the miner uses a small amount of CPU on one thread that goes to the MoneroOcean mining pool to be paid out direct to your wallet. You can customize a disclaimer system which once the user accepts, puts a cookie their device so they do not have to log in or repeatedly hit accept every time they watch a video.

== Installation ==

Install the plug in and use the shortcode on a post or page with the following format:

`[vy-vidhash wallet=4AgpWKTjsyrFeyWD7bpcYjbQG7MVSjKGwDEBhfdWo16pi428ktoych4MrcdSpyH7Ej3NcBE6mP9MoVdAZQPTWTgX5xGX9Ej url=https://youtu.be/4kHl4FoK1Ys]`

- The long code after wallet is your XMR address you want to payout to.
- The URL is the url that you copy from the share format. It must either be the youtu.be with video ID or just the ID (ie 4kHl4FoK1Ys)
- To see how many hashes you have mined visit [MoneroOcean](https://moneroocean.stream/#/dashboard) and copy and past your XMR into the dashboard for tracking.
- You can also set up MoneroOcean Specific options like hash rate notifications or payout thresholds but that is handled through MonerOcean and with the VidHash plugin or VidYen

For Point System support.

- Install [VYPS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/vidyen-point-system-vyps/)
- Example of working shortcodes setup on same page:

`[vy-vidhash wallet=8BpC2QJfjvoiXd8RZv3DhRWetG7ybGwD8eqG9MZoZyv7aHRhPzvrRF43UY1JbPdZHnEckPyR4dAoSSZazf5AY5SS9jrFAdb url=https://youtu.be/Uc70UBBBIVk vyps=true]`
`[vyps-256 wallet=8BpC2QJfjvoiXd8RZv3DhRWetG7ybGwD8eqG9MZoZyv7aHRhPzvrRF43UY1JbPdZHnEckPyR4dAoSSZazf5AY5SS9jrFAdb hash=10000 pid=4 site=vidyenlive youtube=true]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=What are the fees involved?=

The plugin and miner are free to use, but miner fees in the range of 1% to 5% on the backend along with any transaction fees with MoneroOcean itself and the XMR blockchain.

=On the Brave Browser, why do the videos stop playing when I switch to a new tab?=

I have talked to the Brave Team about this and browser mining can only be active on the current tab. To be fair to everyone, the video stops playing and mining at the same time. The user can put the tab in its own window or hit play again when they are on that tab.

=Can I use my own backend server rather than VidHash one's?=

Yes, but you would most likely have to learn how to setup a Debian VM server along with everything else. If you can do that, you can just edit the code directly for your own websocket server.

=Can I use this with VYPS?=

Yes. Please see the shortcode instructions for details. You can now have users watch videos and earn points on your reward store. In effect, you can literally create your own version of AdScend. *coughs*

=Can you help with my Monero wallet?=

You can ask us on our [discord](https://discord.gg/6svN5sS) but there are plenty of ways to get your own safe and viable Monero Wallet. I would suggest reading the [Monero Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/) for different options.

=Can you help me with a problem or question with MoneroOcean?=

VidYen is not affiliated with MoneroOcean. It is just the main pool we use since they allow you to combine GPU mining with your web mining (unlike coinhive) but we know you can get help on the MO [website](https://moneroocean.stream/#/help/faq) or [their discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/) and they will be glad to help you.

=It doesn't really seem to be mining that much?=

It is, but we kept the defaults low to aid with user experience.
